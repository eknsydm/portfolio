                        <span>Hey!</span> I‚Äôm Ekin, a game developer and
                        Computer Engineering student from Turkey. I‚Äôm currently
                        in my 4th year, focused on crafting games with Godot and
                        C++, plus a bit of Unity and pixel art in Aseprite.
                        Right now, I‚Äôm all about making my own games and diving
                        into game jams ‚Äî nothing beats the thrill of creating on
                        a deadline! When I‚Äôm not seeking the fun, I‚Äôm either
                        playing violin or deep into games that challenge and
                        inspire me. (Full achievements in Dark Souls 1 ‚Äî yes, I
                        git and I guded.) I‚Äôm always open to new collaborations
                        and fresh ideas. If you want to team up or just chat
                        about design, dev, or if you‚Äôve got thoughts worth
                        kindling, let‚Äôs light the bonfire.
